# Introduction

My solutions for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) katas. For every completed kata, I'll push both my and other user's solution that I think is tailored to contribute with my learning and adoption of good practices as well.

# Disclaimer

* Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at other people solutions before they finish the Kata themselves

* Codewarriors must not submit other people solutions as their own

# Jargon

* Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire

* Kyu: is the kata's level of difficulty. The lower the number, the harder the execise is to solve.

# Purpose

Practicing katas can help you improve your problem solving and algorithmic skills. It could also help to learn tricks of your preferred language as well as making you feel more confident at interviews for development positions
